I'm a software engineer with a passion for building thoughtful \
products through high-quality engineering practices, no detail is too small. \
I'm devoted to finding root causes, answering questions like "How can we do it \
better?", and being a team multiplier. I love the idea of software engineering \
as a craft and am constantly searching for just the right balance between \
idealism and pragmatism. Currently I lead a team of engineers building \
Wayfair's next-gen streaming ingestion platform at petabyte-scale.\
